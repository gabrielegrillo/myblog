# december so far

## what is useless blog?  

my blog, my rules. jokes aside, I would love to get back my english skills especially in writing. 2 years ago, I was border line with C1 level and now the impostor syndrome got me even more I feel like a B2-lower. why this happend? 

probably the main causes are (not in order of relevance): 

- **not using it much often**: previously i was attending an language school with the primary goal to get certificates but i've lost my interest to go there and also few hobbies were overlapping. although, it was a nice opportunity to practise many areas like writing and speaking rather than surfing the web where you can ONLY practise reading and listening.
- **non-media english **: i was consuming ONLY english content now I feel like I've found a good balance between english and italian media.
- **uni**: doesn't need any explaination 

so back to the main question, this will be my monthly moodboard, thoughts diary or anything that I feel and want. without any scrict guideline or scructure of the post.

## current feeling 

In this month, we are caught up with this overwhelming feeling of buying christmas presents. Choosing for other people that you don't know that much is a pain. this could be one of my many insecurities


or idk the winter session is coming up and I feel dread.


## Gamingfication
